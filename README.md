#ixed Learning Programming - Python and C

### Introduction
The initial weeks focused on exploring Python and C, offering distinct perspectives on programming concepts. Python, with its interpreted nature, provided an accessible entry point due to its high-level abstractions and dynamic typing. In contrast, delving into C's compiled and low-level characteristics demanded a deeper comprehension of memory management and precise control over data types.
